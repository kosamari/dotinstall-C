# Lesson note : C

This is my notes from watching [intro to C at dotinstall](http://dotinstall.com/lessons/basic_c).

## format
If you want to follow along, go through each commits :)
note: I'm comfortable with other programming language (JavaScript/Python) so some notes are very minimal as some syntax and concepts are same as other language.

## execute program
create executable file 
```
gcc -o hello hello.c
```
run executable file 
```
./hello
```

## misc
If you understand Japanese, [ドットインストール](http://dotinstall.com) is a fantastic site to get grasp of many programing languages and frameworks in few hours.
